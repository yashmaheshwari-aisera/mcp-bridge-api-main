## 📚 Introduction

MCP Bridge is a lightweight, fast, and LLM-agnostic proxy that connects to multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified REST API. It enables any client on any platform to leverage MCP functionality without process execution constraints. Unlike Anthropic's official MCP SDK, MCP Bridge is fully independent and designed to work with any LLM backend which makes it adaptable, modular, and future-proof for diverse deployments. With optional risk-based execution levels, it provides granular security controls—from standard execution to confirmation workflows and Docker isolation—while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP clients. 

Complementing this server-side infrastructure are two distinct intelligent client implementations:

1. **Python MCP-Gemini Agent** - A command-line Python client for desktop environments
2. **React Native MCP Agent** - A modern cross-platform mobile application

Both clients enable natural language interaction with MCP tools through intelligent LLM-powered interfaces that feature multi-step reasoning for complex operations, security confirmation workflow handling, and configurable display options for enhanced usability. Together, MCP Bridge's versatile server-side capabilities and these intelligent client interfaces create a powerful ecosystem for developing sophisticated LLM-powered applications.

### ⚠️ The Problem

- Many MCP servers use STDIO transports requiring local process execution
- Edge devices, mobile devices, web browsers, and other platforms cannot efficiently run npm or Python MCP servers
- Direct MCP server connections are impractical in resource-constrained environments
- Multiple isolated clients connecting to the same servers causes redundancy and increases resource usage
- Interacting directly with MCP tools requires technical knowledge of specific tool formats and requirements

### Python Agent Configuration

The Python MCP-Gemini Agent supports several command-line options:

```
usage: llm_test.py [-h] [--hide-json] [--json-width JSON_WIDTH] [--mcp-url MCP_URL] [--mcp-port MCP_PORT]

MCP-Gemini Agent with configurable settings

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --hide-json           Hide JSON results from tool executions
  --json-width JSON_WIDTH
                        Maximum width for JSON output (default: 100)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### MCP Bridge Configuration

MCP Bridge is configured through a JSON file named `mcp_config.json` in the project root. This is an example of a basic MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"],
      "riskLevel": 2
    },
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "your-slack-token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "your-team-id"
      },
      "riskLevel": 1
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 API Usage

## 🔐 Risk Levels

MCP Bridge implements an optional risk level system that provides control over server execution behaviors. Risk levels help manage security and resource concerns when executing potentially sensitive MCP server operations.

### Risk Level Classification

| Level | Name | Description | Behavior |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Low | Standard execution | Direct execution without confirmation |
| 2 | Medium | Requires confirmation | Client must confirm execution before processing |
| 3 | High | Docker execution required | Server runs in isolated Docker container |

### Configuring Risk Levels

Risk levels are optional for backward compatibility. You can configure risk levels in your `mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"],
      "riskLevel": 2
    },
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "your-slack-token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "your-team-id"
      },
      "riskLevel": 1
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"
      },
      "riskLevel": 3,
      "docker": {
        "image": "node:18",
        "volumes": ["/tmp:/tmp"],
        "network": "host"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Risk Level Workflows

#### Low Risk (Level 1)
- Standard execution without additional steps
- Suitable for operations with minimal security concerns
- This is the default behavior when no risk level is specified

#### Medium Risk (Level 2)
1. Client makes a tool execution request
2. Server responds with a confirmation request containing a confirmation ID
3. Client must make a separate confirmation request to proceed
4. Only after confirmation does the server execute the operation

Both the Python MCP-Gemini Agent and React Native Agent handle this confirmation flow automatically, prompting the user for approval when needed.

#### High Risk (Level 3)
- Server automatically runs in an isolated Docker container
- Provides environmental isolation for the MCP server process
- Requires Docker to be installed and properly configured
